# Modulation Inertia

This is a utility device that provide some inertia to a modulation signal.

* *Input* - The input signal, shown as the blue line in the graph. Chances are you would map something to this knob.
* *Rise* - How much time the output signal should take to rise to a higher input value.
* *Fall* - The amount of time the output signal should fall to a lower input value.

Try setting Rise and Fall to medium values and move the Input knob rapidly to see this in action.
